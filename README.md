# Cetacean.excretion.global
This project is a chapter of my PhD research on the role of marine mammals in 
nutrient cycling and carbon storage. In this chapter, we estimate total excretion
of nutrients by cetacean population in several places around the globe. 


This github project was created from an existing project but adapted to be 
suitable for the use of Git, renv and target tools.
