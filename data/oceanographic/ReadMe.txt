Data was downloaded from https://neo.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/. 
We chose July 2018 for both chlorophyll and sst, for sst we chos the MODIS data (2006+). We used the button "Download Raw Data". 
For chlorophyll, it does not seem that the name of the file contains the true date: there is the year, but for the month 
format is weird. 

28/10/21: For both files, apparently the website was bugging: we could not download July, as when we asked for July the name of the file still 
indicated it was December 2018 instead. We will try again soon.
