Data was downloaded from https://neo.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/. Tab "OCEAN"
We chose July 2018 for both chlorophyll and sst, for sst we chos the MODIS data (2002+). 
Then, we choose the month we want (June 2021), and we press the button "Download Raw Data". You must have
a free account logged in to download the data.

I am not sure the date are the ones we want, does not seem to change when we change the month! 

For chlorophyll, it does not seem that the name of the file contains the true date: there is the year, 
but for the month format is weird. And it does not change when we ask for another month. So well well, 
not so good! 

For sst, it seems that we just have December month, 2021 here!
